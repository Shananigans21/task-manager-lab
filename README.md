# Lab: Task Manager
A simple React app for managing tasks â€” add new tasks, mark them completed, and search/filter tasks in real-time. Built using React hooks: useContext for global state, useId for unique IDs, and useRef for optimized inputs.

#Features

View all tasks on page load (data fetched from backend)
Add new tasks through a controlled form
Mark tasks as completed or undo completion
Search tasks by name with live filtering
Global state management with React Context API
Accessibility improvements using useId
Getting Started

Open the app in your browser at http://localhost:3000 or the port specified by your dev server.

Usage
